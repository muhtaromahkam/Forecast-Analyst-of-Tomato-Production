### Introduction
Tomato production forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient distribution, pricing, and availability of tomatoes in the market. This project focuses on the West Lampung region and employs the ARIMA model to analyze historical tomato production data and predict future production levels.

### Methodology

The methodology involves the following steps:

- **Data Collection**: Historical tomato production data for West Lampung is collected from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is cleaned, checked for inconsistencies, and any missing values are appropriately handled.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A preliminary analysis of the data is performed to understand the patterns, trends, and seasonality in tomato production.
- **Model Selection**: The ARIMA model is chosen for its effectiveness in capturing time series patterns.
- **Model Training**: The ARIMA model is trained on the historical data, and its parameters are tuned for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The trained model's accuracy is assessed using appropriate metrics and validated with a holdout dataset.
- **Forecasting**: The model is used to forecast tomato production for a certain period into the future.
- **Results Interpretation**: The forecasted results are visualized and explained for stakeholders.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/muhtaromahkam/Internship-Report.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project`
3. Install the required dependencies if any (list dependencies and how to install them).
4. Run the provided Jupyter notebook or R script to reproduce the forecasting process.


### Results
The forecasting results are presented in the result directory. Visualizations showcase the predicted tomato production trends for the specified period. Additionally, the evaluation metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the ARIMA model's predictions.
